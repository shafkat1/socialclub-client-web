## üìã YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (5 minutes)

### STEP 1: Go to GitHub Settings

Navigate to:
```
https://github.com/shafkat1/socialclub-client-web/settings/secrets/actions
```

### STEP 2: Add 9 Critical Secrets

Click **"New repository secret"** and add these values:

```
1. AWS_ROLE_ARN
   arn:aws:iam::425687053209:role/github-actions-role

2. AWS_REGION
   us-east-1

3. AWS_S3_STAGING_BUCKET
   clubapp-dev-assets

4. AWS_S3_PRODUCTION_BUCKET
   clubapp-dev-assets

5. AWS_CLOUDFRONT_STAGING_ID
   E32TNLEZPNE766

6. AWS_CLOUDFRONT_PRODUCTION_ID
   E32TNLEZPNE766

7. AWS_ECR_REGISTRY
   425687053209.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

8. VITE_API_URL
   https://api.desh.co/api

9. BACKEND_API_URL
   https://api.desh.co/api
```

**For each secret:**
- Click "New repository secret"
- Paste the Name (e.g., `AWS_ROLE_ARN`)
- Paste the Value
- Click "Add secret"
- Repeat for next secret

### STEP 3: Verify Secrets Added

After adding all 9 secrets, you should see them listed in the Actions secrets section (shown as dots for security).

### STEP 4: Trigger Deployment

```bash
cd C:\ai4\socialclub-deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Secrets configured - ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### STEP 5: Monitor Deployment

Go to: **https://github.com/shafkat1/socialclub-client-web/actions**

You'll see both workflows start:
- Frontend Deploy (expected time: 10 minutes)
- Backend & Infrastructure Deploy (expected time: 25 minutes)
