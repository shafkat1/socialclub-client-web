## 📊 Latest Status

### Run #7 & #8: NEW FIX DEPLOYED

**Commit**: `6f6d87ff` - "Fix ESLint lint script to use correct directory and extensions"

**What Changed**:
```json
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
"lint": "eslint \"{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts\" --fix"

// AFTER (FIXED):
"lint": "eslint src --ext .ts --fix"
```

**Reason**: The previous ESLint pattern was searching in incorrect directories when run from workspace root. The new pattern explicitly targets just the `src` directory with `.ts` extensions.

## 🔄 Current Workflow Status

| Workflow | Commit | Status | Duration | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Backend CI/CD Pipeline #3** | `6f6d87ff` | ❌ **FAILED** | 43s | Still failing - needs investigation |

## 🚨 Issue Still Persisting

Even with the lint script fix, Backend CI/CD Pipeline is still failing at **43 seconds**.

**Possible Causes**:
1. ESLint is still not finding the config from the right directory
2. The working directory in the workflow is still incorrect
3. Docker build context issues
4. ESLint plugin dependencies not installed

**Next Action**: Check Backend CI/CD Pipeline #3 logs to see exact error message.

## ✅ Fixes Applied So Far

1. ✅ Created `.eslintrc.json` in `backend/` (Commit `b533a47`)
2. ✅ Created `.eslintignore` in `backend/` (Commit `b533a47`)
3. ✅ Changed Vite `outDir` from `build` to `dist`
4. ✅ Fixed ESLint lint script to use explicit `src` directory (Commit `6f6d87ff`)

## 📋 Files Modified

**Commit b533a47**:
- `backend/.eslintrc.json` - Created
- `backend/.eslintignore` - Created

**Commit 6f6d87ff**:
- `backend/package.json` - Updated lint script

## 🎯 Next Steps

### If Backend & Infrastructure #7 PASSES ✅
- Frontend should auto-deploy to S3/CloudFront
- Backend should build Docker image
- Terraform should apply infrastructure

### If Backend & Infrastructure #7 FAILS ❌
- Need to check Docker build logs
- May need to add ESLint config to Docker build context
- Consider running ESLint config from `backend/` explicitly
