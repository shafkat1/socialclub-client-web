## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: API Routing (404 on /api/*)

**Status**: Under Investigation
**Symptoms**: 
- `/health` works (200 OK)
- `/api/*` returns 404

**Possible Causes**:
1. NestJS global prefix not properly configured
2. ALB routing needs adjustment
3. Container startup issue

**Resolution**:
- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs for errors
- [ ] Verify task definition PORT environment
- [ ] Review ALB target group configuration
- [ ] Force new ECS deployment
