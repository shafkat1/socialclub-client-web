## 🔍 Issue Analysis

### Root Cause Identified
Earlier commits (`6eecccb5` - "Redeploy - trigger all workflows") did NOT trigger workflows because:
- **README.md changes alone don't trigger GitHub Actions**
- The workflow files did not include `'README.md'` in their `paths:` filter
- Only specific files trigger workflows (src/**, package.json, etc.)

### Fix Applied ✅
**Commit c5548fec** - Modified workflow trigger paths:
```yaml
# Added to both frontend.yml and backend.yml
paths:
  - 'README.md'  # ← NEWLY ADDED
```

### Result
✅ Workflows NOW triggered successfully
- Frontend: Still building (in progress)
- Backend: Failed during build
