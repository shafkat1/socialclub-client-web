## 📊 **PARALLEL PIPELINES RUNNING**

### **Pipeline 1: Backend & Infrastructure Deploy**
- **Status**: ⏳ RUNNING
- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **What it does**:
  - AWS OIDC authentication
  - Terraform infrastructure deployment
  - Docker image build & push
  - Backend deployment to ECS

### **Pipeline 2: Backend CI/CD Pipeline**  
- **Status**: ⏳ RUNNING
- **Duration**: ~20 minutes
- **What it does**:
  - ESLint linting (should pass)
  - Unit tests (should pass)
  - Test coverage (should pass)
  - NestJS build
  - Docker build & push to ECR

### **Pipeline 3: Frontend Deployment**
- **Status**: ⏳ PENDING
- **Duration**: ~10 minutes
- **What it does**:
  - Vite React build
  - Upload to S3
  - CloudFront cache invalidation

---

## 🎯 **KEY MILESTONE: OIDC AUTHENTICATION**

**This is the critical test that proves everything is working!**

```
Before (❌ FAILED):
  └─ AWS returned: "Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
  └─ Reason: OIDC role didn't exist

After (✅ SHOULD PASS):
  └─ GitHub OIDC token is valid
  └─ AWS trusts the token
  └─ Authentication succeeds
  └─ Deployment continues
```

**Watch for**: The "Configure AWS credentials (OIDC)" step should show a GREEN ✅ check for the first time!

## 🔗 **REAL-TIME MONITORING**

### **Live Dashboard**
👉 **Go to**: https://github.com/shafkat1/socialclub-client-web/actions

### **What to Monitor**

1. **Scroll to top** - Should see new workflow runs
2. **Look for commit** `6fe7dcee` or recent timestamps
3. **Check status** - Should show:
   - 🟡 Yellow = In progress
   - 🟢 Green = Success
   - 🔴 Red = Failed

### **Most Important Steps to Watch**

```
1. Configure AWS credentials (OIDC)     ← Most critical!
   └─ Should show ✅ green (was ❌ before)
   
2. Terraform Apply
   └─ Should show ✅ green
   
3. Build and push Docker image
   └─ Should show ✅ green
   
4. Deploy to ECS
   └─ Should show ✅ green
   
5. Build and deploy frontend
   └─ Should show ✅ green
```
