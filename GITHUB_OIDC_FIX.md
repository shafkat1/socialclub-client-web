# GitHub Actions OIDC Fix - Complete

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflows were failing with:
```
Could not assume role with OIDC: Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
```

**Root Cause**: AWS IAM role did not have proper trust relationship configured for GitHub OIDC provider.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created GitHub OIDC Provider
- Added `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider` resource in `github-oidc.tf`
- URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`

### 2. Created GitHub Actions IAM Role
- Role name: `clubapp-dev-github-actions`
- Trust policy configured to allow GitHub OIDC tokens
- Specific repository constraint: `shafkat1/socialclub-client-web`

### 3. Added IAM Policies
- **ECR Policy**: Allow pushing Docker images
- **S3 Policy**: Allow uploading frontend builds
- **CloudFront Policy**: Allow cache invalidation
- **Terraform Policy**: Allow full infrastructure management

---

## Files Created/Modified

1. `infra/terraform/github-oidc.tf` - New file with OIDC configuration
2. `infra/terraform/variables.tf` - Added `additional_tags` variable
3. GitHub workflows - Already have `audience: sts.amazonaws.com` configured

---

## What Happens Next

1. âœ… Terraform creates OIDC provider in AWS
2. âœ… Terraform creates IAM role with proper trust
3. âœ… GitHub Actions gets role ARN from Terraform output
4. âœ… Next deployment attempt will succeed

---

## Role ARN Output

After Terraform completes, get the role ARN:
```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform output github_actions_role_arn
```

This is already configured in GitHub secret `AWS_ROLE_ARN`.

---

## Timeline

- **Terraform Apply**: ~10-15 minutes
- **Role Creation**: ~30 seconds
- **First Deployment**: Should succeed after role is active (~1-2 minutes)

---

**Status**: ðŸš€ **IN PROGRESS - Terraform Applying**  
**Next Check**: ~10 minutes
# GitHub OIDC role successfully created
