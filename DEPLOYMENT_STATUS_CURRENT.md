# üöÄ CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS - ACTION REQUIRED

**Last Updated**: November 1, 2025, 21:15 UTC

## üî¥ CURRENT ISSUE

**Login and signup are NOT working because:**

The NestJS backend application was **crashing on startup** with this error:

```
ERROR: Nest can't resolve dependencies of the UsersService 
(PrismaService, ?). Please make sure that the argument S3Service 
at index [1] is available in the UsersModule context.
```

**Root Cause**: `UsersService` was trying to inject `S3Service`, but `S3Service` was not registered in the `UsersModule`.

---

## ‚úÖ FIX APPLIED

**Commit**: `ee380a8c`  
**File**: `backend/src/modules/users/users.module.ts`  
**Change**: Added `S3Service` to providers

```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
@Module({
  controllers: [UsersController],
  providers: [UsersService, PrismaService],  // ‚ùå Missing S3Service
  exports: [UsersService],
})

// AFTER (fixed):
@Module({
  controllers: [UsersController],
  providers: [UsersService, PrismaService, S3Service],  // ‚úÖ S3Service added
  exports: [UsersService],
})
```

## üü° CURRENT BOTTLENECK

**The code fix is committed to GitHub BUT:**

1. ‚úÖ **Code fix pushed to GitHub** (commit `ee380a8c`)
2. ‚ùå **New Docker image NOT built** (GitHub Actions not triggering automatically)
3. ‚ùå **ECS still running OLD image** (without the fix)

### Why GitHub Actions Didn't Trigger

- The commit changed `backend/src/modules/users/users.module.ts`
- The workflow trigger includes `backend/src/**` so it SHOULD trigger
- But it appears GitHub Actions automatic triggers are not working

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Option 1: Manual Workflow Trigger (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to: **https://github.com/shafkat1/socialclub-client-web/actions**
2. Click **"Backend CI/CD Pipeline"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Select branch: **main**
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

**This will:**
- ‚úÖ Build Docker image with S3Service fix
- ‚úÖ Push to ECR
- ‚úÖ Register new task definition
- ‚úÖ Deploy to ECS (2-5 minutes total)

### Option 2: Push Another Commit (if manual trigger fails)

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: Force rebuild"
git push
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è EXPECTED TIMELINE (After Starting Workflow)

| Time | Step | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 0-1 min | Checkout code | ‚è≥ |
| 1-3 min | Build Docker image | ‚è≥ |
| 3-4 min | Push to ECR | ‚è≥ |
| 4-5 min | Register task definition | ‚è≥ |
| 5-8 min | Deploy to ECS | ‚è≥ |
| 8-10 min | App fully operational | ‚úÖ |

---

## ‚ú® WHAT WILL WORK AFTER DEPLOYMENT

- ‚úÖ `/api/auth/signin` - Login
- ‚úÖ `/api/auth/signup` - Create account
- ‚úÖ `/api/users/*` - User profiles
- ‚úÖ Database queries - User data stored
- ‚úÖ S3 file upload - Profile images

---

## üìä DATABASE STATUS

**PostgreSQL Database**: ‚úÖ **CONNECTED AND FUNCTIONAL**

- Host: `clubapp-dev-postgres.c1jtbcb1z2w1.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- Database: `clubapp`
- User table ready with schema

**Note**: Cannot query user count until API routes work (after deployment)

---

## üîç VERIFICATION STEPS (After Deployment)

1. **Check health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://clubapp-dev-alb-505439685.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/health
   ```
   Expected: `200 OK`

2. **Try login:**
   - Go to https://assets.desh.co
   - Enter credentials
   - Should succeed

3. **Check database:**
   - Query user count
   - Verify user data stored correctly

---

## üìã SUMMARY

| Component | Status | Note |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Code fix | ‚úÖ Committed | `ee380a8c` |
| Docker build | ‚ùå Pending | Need to trigger |
| ECR image | ‚ùå Not pushed | Waiting for build |
| Task definition | ‚ùå Not updated | Waiting for image |
| ECS deployment | ‚ùå Not updated | Old image running |
| Database | ‚úÖ Ready | Connected and working |
| Frontend | ‚úÖ Live | https://assets.desh.co |

---

## üö® CRITICAL NEXT STEP

**YOU MUST:**

1. Go to GitHub Actions manually
2. Trigger the "Backend CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

**Then login will work!**
