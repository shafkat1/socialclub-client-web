## 🎯 CURRENT SITUATION

You asked me to **monitor all GitHub Actions pipelines** and ensure they are not failing.

### ✅ Actions Taken

1. **Identified Critical Issue** - ESLint configuration was missing in backend
2. **Created ESLint Config** - Added `.eslintrc.json` and `.eslintignore` to backend
3. **Fixed Vite Build** - Changed output directory from `build` to `dist`
4. **Fixed ESLint Script** - Updated `backend/package.json` lint script to use correct paths
5. **Deployed Fixes** - Pushed changes to GitHub to trigger new builds

### 🔄 Current Pipeline Status

| Pipeline | Status | Commit | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Backend CI/CD** | ❌ FAILED (43s) | `6f6d87ff` | Investigate further |
| **Backend & Infra** | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | `6f6d87ff` | Awaiting completion |
| **Frontend CI/CD** | ❓ Not yet run | `6f6d87ff` | Will run after backend |

---

## 🚨 WHAT'S CURRENTLY FAILING

**Backend CI/CD Pipeline #3**:
- **Duration**: 43 seconds (failed quickly)
- **Error**: Likely ESLint still not finding config
- **Root Cause**: May be running from wrong directory in Docker

**What We Know**:
- `.eslintrc.json` ✅ - Committed and verified in Git
- `.eslintignore` ✅ - Committed and verified in Git
- `package.json` ✅ - Updated with correct lint script

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Fixed Issues

**Issue #1: Missing ESLint Config**
- **File**: `backend/.eslintrc.json`
- **Status**: ✅ Created and committed
- **Commit**: `b533a47`

**Issue #2: Missing ESLint Ignore**
- **File**: `backend/.eslintignore`  
- **Status**: ✅ Created and committed
- **Commit**: `b533a47`

**Issue #3: Vite Build Output**
- **File**: `vite.config.ts`
- **Change**: `outDir: 'build'` → `outDir: 'dist'`
- **Reason**: GitHub Actions workflow expects `dist/` folder
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**Issue #4: ESLint Script Path**
- **File**: `backend/package.json`
- **Change**: `"lint": "eslint \"{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts\" --fix"` → `"lint": "eslint src --ext .ts --fix"`
- **Reason**: Previous pattern wasn't working from workflow context
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed (Commit `6f6d87ff`)

## ⚠️ WHAT STILL NEEDS INVESTIGATION

1. **Why Backend CI/CD still fails at 43s**
   - Possible: ESLint not finding config in Docker context
   - Need to check: Docker build working directory
   - Next Step: Review full error logs

2. **Backend & Infrastructure deployment**
   - Status: Still running (should complete within 5-10 minutes)
   - Expected outcome: Docker build + Terraform + deployment

3. **Frontend deployment**
   - Status: Not yet triggered
   - Will run after backend completes
   - Expected: Build → S3 upload → CloudFront invalidation

## 📋 MONITORING CHECKLIST

- [x] Identified pipeline issues
- [x] Created missing configuration files
- [x] Fixed build output directory
- [x] Fixed ESLint script path
- [x] Deployed fixes to GitHub
- [x] Triggered new workflow runs
- [ ] Confirmed all workflows passing
- [ ] Deployed to production

## 🎬 NEXT ACTIONS

### Immediate (Within 5 minutes)
1. Wait for Backend & Infrastructure #7 to complete
2. Check if it PASSED ✅ or FAILED ❌
3. If PASSED: Frontend should auto-deploy
4. If FAILED: Investigate Docker build logs

### Short-term (If still failing)
1. Check ESLint error message in full logs
2. Verify `.eslintrc.json` is in Docker build context
3. May need to explicitly copy config to Docker image
4. Consider disabling linting temporarily to allow build

### Long-term
1. Once builds pass: Monitor for deployment issues
2. Check CloudFront distribution  
3. Verify S3 bucket uploads
4. Test application endpoints

## 🎯 SUMMARY

**What's Working**:
- ✅ Configuration files are properly committed
- ✅ Vite build output directory fixed
- ✅ ESLint script updated
- ✅ GitHub workflows are triggering properly
- ✅ New deployment runs initiated

**What Needs Work**:
- ❌ Backend CI/CD is still failing (needs investigation)
- ⏳ Backend & Infrastructure deployment in progress
- ⏳ Frontend deployment pending

**Recommendation**:
Wait 5-10 more minutes for Backend & Infrastructure #7 to complete, then review logs to determine if the latest fix worked. If it passes, the full deployment pipeline should proceed automatically.
